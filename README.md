# Gothic Architecture Website

This was initially a final project for an art history class but I am proud of how it turned out so I though I could share it and maybe update it later. This site was meant to be an informative website about the architectural style, so it introduces it and its features while also displaying some prominent examples.

This was meant to be a simple static webpage that can be served and accessed without any real setup. As of 5/5/2025 it bee continue to be this way any the only requirement to serve it is to keep the project directory structure.

## index.html
This is the landing lage for the site. It introduces you to a brief overview of gothic architecture.

## outside.html
This page covers the exterior features that distinguish the style from others. I tried to shy away from religous symbolism since that is usually present on religous buildings in some form or another, regardless of the style they are in. Each feature references an example of a real building.

## inside.html
This page covers the interior features that distinguish the style from others. Again, I tried to shy away from religous symbolism for the same reasons as above. Each feature references an example of a real building.

## gallery.html
This page is a "dictionary" of sorts for the buildings mentioned in the other pages. When a feature covers a particular building, it is gaurenteed to be in the gallery since thats how I want it formatted. But, that doesnt mean that I wont also sneak in my personal favorite buildings into the gallery just because I can.

# Dependencies
This project makes use of PicoCSS for the lightweight css framework. I liked using this framewrok and will probably continue to use it going forward with my next projects that make simple webpages. It is usually kinda annoying to get everything looking consistant and responsive so this let me cut that corner.
