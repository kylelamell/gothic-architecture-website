# Gothic Architecture Website

This was initially a final project for an art history class but I am proud of how it turned out so I though I could share it and maybe update it later. This site was meant to be an informative website about the architectural style, so it introduces it and its features while also displaying some prominent examples.

## index.html
This is the landing lage for the site. It introduces you to a brief overview of gothic architecture.

## outside.html
This page covers the exterior features that distinguish the style from others. I tried to shy away from religous symbolism since that is usually present on religous buildings in some form or another, regardless of the style they are in. Each feature references an example of a real building.

## inside.html
This page covers the interior features that distinguish the style from others. Again, I tried to shy away from religous symbolism for the same reasons as above. Each feature references an example of a real building.

## gallery.html
This page is a "dictionary" of sorts for the buildings mentioned in the other pages. When a feature covers a particular building, it is gaurenteed to be in the gallery since thats how I want it formatted. But, that doesnt mean that I wont also sneak in my personal favorite buildings into the gallery just because I can.
