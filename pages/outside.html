            <h3>Flying Buttresses</h3>
            <h4>Abbey Church of Saint-Denis</h4>
          </hgroup>
          <summary>Flying buttresses are an architecturaly defining feature of Gothic architecture, acting as exterior supports that redistribute the weight of the heavy vaulted ceilings. This innovation allowed for taller naves, thinner walls, and larger windows, defining characteristics of the Gothic style. Pictured below is an example from the <a href="./gallery.html#st-denis">Abbey Church of Saint-Denis</a>.</summary>

          <summary>Originating in the 12th century, Rose windows are a prominent feature of Gothic cathedrals. Identified by their large circular shape and intricate repeating patterns adorned with stained glass. They make use radiating light and color into the sacred space to represent divinity and holiness. Depicted below we have the rose windows of the <a href="./gallery.html#reims-cathedral">Reims Cathedral</a>.</summary>

            <h3>Lancet Windows</h3>
            <h4>Chartres Cathedral</h4>
          </hgroup>
          <summary>Lancet windows are a hallmark of Gothic architecture. They are characterized by their tall, narrow, and pointed arch shape. They fill the interior with light which was an advancement over the darker interiors of building featuring romanesque architectures. Lancet windows are accompanied by buttressing of the exterior wall to make up for the loss of material to hold up the heavy ceilings. Below we have the north transept of the <a href="./gallery.html#chartres-cathedral">Chartres Cathedral</a>.</summary>

            <h3>Intricate Facades</h3>
            <h4>Cologne Cathadral</h4>
          </hgroup>
          <summary>The inclusion of intricate and very light looking facade work is probably the most distinguishing feature of gothic architecture. Its best to look at an example to better put it into words, below we have one of the towers of the <a href="./gallery.html#cologne-cathedral">Cologne Cathadral</a>. We can see the extrensive use of detail, not only adding to the structure to add detail but also subtracting from it. This is one of the identifier of gothic architecture, how light it looks through use of cavities in the structure itself.</summary>
