          <summary>Gothic arhitecture is considered to have started with the <a href="./pages/gallery.html#st-denis">Abbey Church of Saint-Denis</a> around 1144 to 1281. While may of the architectural styles that compose the gothic style existed beforehand, at this point they coalesced to bring into existence the gothic style. The <a href="./pages/gallery.html#st-denis">Abbey Church of Saint-Denis</a> was an experimental work brough on by Abbot Suger who found that many renowned architects could be brough together to create a new style.</summary>
          <summary>As the style gained popularity there were some buildings where a distinction could be made in the stylistic choices. For example, The <a href="./pages/gallery.html#wells-cathedral">Wells Cathdral</a> was also made in the gothic style, but bears some differences in its facade. This presents as the decrease in open space present, as it has more dense features that fill the cavities of the original style. It also appears much more stout and combined with the cavities being filled with detail, gives a stronger and heavier exterior presence. Due to this we may sometimes make the distinction between the French gothic style and English gothic style.</summary>
